## ?? What Needs to Be Built

### Phase 4: Valuation Screener (2-3 days)
- ValuationService (GARP scoring, ranges, signals)
- ValuationScreener component (filtering UI)
- Integration into Dashboard

### Phase 5: Quality Scoring (3-4 days)
- QualityScoreService (multi-factor scoring)
- QualityDashboard component (grades, red flags)
- Sector comparison

### Phase 6: Risk Analysis (2-3 days)

- Integration tests

---

## ?? Top Recommendations

### Immediate (1-2 days)
1. Add unit tests for Phase 1-3 code
2. Verify all 77 profiles import correctly
3. Test with 10+ holding portfolio

### Short-term (2-4 weeks)
4. Implement Phase 4 (Valuation Screener)
5. Add more visualizations (charts)
6. Create missing components (sector UI)

### Medium-term (4-8 weeks)
7. Implement Phase 5 (Quality Scoring)
8. Implement Phase 6 (Risk Analysis)
9. Comprehensive testing and optimization
